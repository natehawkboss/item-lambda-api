# The public entrypoint: an API Gateway HTTP API proxying to the Lambda.
#
# Tradeoff worth stating: HTTP API integrations time out at 29 seconds.
# Irrelevant here — every endpoint is a small indexed query — but it is exactly
# the ceiling that would rule this out for heavy report generation, which would
# want a job-and-poll design instead. (A Lambda Function URL avoids that limit;
# see the README for why this deployment doesn't use one.)
